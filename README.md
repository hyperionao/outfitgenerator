# outfitgenerator
An outfit generator made in Java (hopefully!). Wish to recreate it in other languages to become proficient in them. 

I was inspired by a TikTok user sometime ago who made something similar a year ago. I cannot find his account so I decided to try and make my own. My original plan: user provides three different folders: one of tops, one of pants, and one of shoes. 

Different features I want to include: filter all categories of clothing by color, introduce the idea of neutrals in, and a little weather easter egg so that the user knows what the weather will be in their area before they go out. 

Another one of my first projects so hope whoever is reading this enjoys it!
